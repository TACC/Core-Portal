    <h2>Request Access to the SD2E Platform</h2>
    <p>At this time, access is restricted to SD2 project members. Your username and password will be the same as your TACC username and password.</p>
    <h4>Create a TACC account</h4>
    <p>To create a TACC username and password, please visit this site: <a href="https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/web/tup/account-request" target="_blank">https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/web/tup/account-request</a></p>

    <p>You must agree to the TACC Acceptable Use Policy, and then fill out the Account Request form.</p>
    <p>After submitting the Account Request form, you should receive a confirmation email. Please go ahead and confirm.</p>
    <p>Once your email is confirmed, your account request will then be reviewed. Account approval should occur within 1 business day. You should receive an email when your account is approved.</p>
    <p>After your account is approved, please log back into the <a href="https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu" target="_blank">TACC User Portal</a> and complete Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). For MFA, follow the TACC Auth App instructions, and we suggest substituting in the Google Authenticator App instead. MFA instructions are available here: <a href="https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tutorials/multifactor-authentication" target="_blank">https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tutorials/multifactor-authentication.</a></p>

    <h3>Request access to SD2E computational resources</h3>
    <p>
      After your TACC account is set up, we still need to link the account to the specific resources for this project.  To do this, once you have received e-mail confirmation of TACC account creation, and before logging into SD2E.org, please enter your username and password below:
