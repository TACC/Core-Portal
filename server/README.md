# TACC Frontera Web Portal - Server

## Directories

- _`cms`_: Isolate assets for the CMS website.
- `conf`: Configure services (like CMS, Nginx, and Docker that runs them).
- _`docs`_: Isolate assets for the Tech Docs / User Guide.
- _`media`_: Dumped assets for the temporary CMS in which the Portal runs.
- `portal`: Isolate code for the Portal.
- _`static`_: Dumped assets for the temporary CMS in which the Portal runs.

Any _`italic`_ directories are dynamically created, thus should be ignored by version control.
