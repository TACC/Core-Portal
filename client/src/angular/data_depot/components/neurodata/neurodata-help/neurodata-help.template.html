    <p>The Neurodata browser can be used to preview data sets and save cutouts
        to a project or personal storage system for further processing.
        The hierarchy of collections, experiments, and channels can be browsed
        analogously to file systems in the other panes of the Data Browser.
        Selecting a channel opens a popup with information about that
        channel and utilities for managing cutouts.</p>

    <p>The coordinate table in the top right of the channel display window shows
        allowable coordinates for generating a cutout as well as the metric used
        to define voxels.</p>

    <p>To generate a cutout, enter the desired x, y, and z coordinates into the
        provided form fields and click the “Preview Cutout” or “Save to Data Files”
        button. If the channel supports JPEG visualization, selecting “Preview
        cutout” will display the image in your browser window.</p>

    <p>To save the cutout for further analysis, enter a filename in the provided
        field (or leave blank to use an auto-generated filename) and select the
        preferred file type (JPG, blosc, or blosc-python) from the attached
        pull-down menu. Clicking “Save to Data Files” will then allow you to select
        a folder in My Data or My Projects to download the cutout to. This saved
        file can be accessed through any application in the Applications section of
        3DEM.</p>
